to run a program in your `pwd` present working directory (fancy speak for where
you are in the system) you type in `./programname` you can try to run anything
but for something to run you need the file to have the execute permission on a
group that applies to you. your actually running programs when you type `ls` and
`cat` but you don't need the `./` for them as they are in your path. the path is
the list of folders that the terminal will search through to find a matching
program. common path directories are /bin /user/bin /user/share/bin
