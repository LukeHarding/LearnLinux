LearnLinux
==========

This is my attempt at making an open course that everyone can use to teach friends and colleagues how to learn linux

I want this to be a fun course that isn't intimidating while providing useful
information with a bit of humor thrown in. think good eats with Alton Brown, but
for Linux instead of cooking.
